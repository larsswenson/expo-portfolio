# Personal Portfolio App

This project is a simple personal portfolio app built with React Native and Expo Router. It showcases my portfolio, including projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to myself & the portfolio.
- **Projects Page**: Routes to various projects.
- **Skills Page**: Listing of professional skills and technologies.
- **Contact Page**: Contact details and links to professional profiles.

Built With:
React Native - Framework used
Expo - Open-source platform for making universal native apps
Expo Router - Routing and navigation for Expo apps

Design Choices:

My goal was for the design to be as minimal and elegant as possible for a professional, clean, and concise impression.

Challenges faced:

As always, getting images to render correctly was frustratingly difficult! Through experience, the navigation became more intuitive.
